# Setting Up and Monitoring a REST API Using json-server on Windows 11

## Introduction

This detailed guide explains how to set up a REST API using json-server within a Docker container on Windows 11 and monitor network traffic with Wireshark. It also includes best practices for interacting with the API using `curl` commands, emphasizing common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## Tools Used

- **Windows 11 (Version 22H2)**
- **Docker version 26.0.0, build 2ae903e**
- **Wireshark version 4.2.4**
- **json-server**
- **`curl` for Windows**

This documentation is inspired and guided by the foundational resources available at [DevOps Cell](https://devopscell.com/api/rest/json/nodejs/docker/2017/09/27/api-rest-json-server-nodejs-docker.html).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Configure Your Working Environment

#### Create a Project Directory 
1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
   - Search for "cmd" in the Start menu, right-click on Command Prompt, and select "Run as administrator".

2. **Navigate to Your Desktop (for Excample) and Create a Directory**:
   ```cmd
   cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop
   mkdir jsonserver
   cd jsonserver
   ```

### Step 2: Create and Configure Dockerfile

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   - Ensure that the file is named `Dockerfile` and not `Dockerfile.txt`. A common error is saving the file with a `.txt` extension, which Docker will not recognize.
   - Use a text editor to create a Dockerfile with the following contents:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:latest
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN npm install -g json-server
   RUN echo '{"cars":[{"id":1,"brand":"opel","model":"corsa"},{"id":2,"brand":"ford","model":"fiesta"}]}' > /app/db.json
   EXPOSE 8080
   CMD ["json-server", "--watch", "/app/db.json", "--port", "8080", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Execute the following command to build the Docker image:
     ```cmd
     docker build -t jsonserver .
     ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   - Start the json-server with this command:
     ```cmd
     docker run --rm -it --name jsonserver-container -p 8080:8080 jsonserver
     ```

### Step 3: Monitor API Traffic with Wireshark

1. **Open Wireshark**:
   - Launch Wireshark and select the Loopback interface for capturing traffic. This interface will capture all local traffic between your machine and the json-server.

2. **Apply the Filter**:
   - Set the display filter to `tcp.port == 8080` to focus on the API traffic:
     ```wireshark
     tcp.port == 8080
     ```

3. **Start the Capture**:
   - Begin capturing data before initiating any API requests to ensure all traffic is logged.

4. **Analyze Traffic**:
   - Use the `Follow` > `HTTP Stream` function on relevant packets to view detailed HTTP communication.

### Step 4: Interact with the API Using Curl

Each `curl` command is presented in its own box for clarity, with a comment explaining its purpose.

#### Retrieve All Entries (GET)
```cmd
# Fetch all car entries from the API
curl -v http://localhost:8080/cars
```

#### Create a New Entry (POST)
```cmd
# Create a new car entry in the database
curl -v -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"brand\":\"Volkswagen\",\"model\":\"Golf\"}" http://localhost:8080/cars
```

#### Update an Existing Entry by ID (PUT)
```cmd
# Update an existing car entry by ID
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d "{\"brand\":\"Audi\",\"model\":\"A4\"}" http://localhost:8080/cars/1
```

#### Delete an Entry by ID (DELETE)
```cmd
# Remove a car entry by ID
curl -v -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cars/1
```

#### Advanced Queries Using Verbose Mode
```cmd
# Sort entries by model; not using "asc" as it is default and implicit
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/cars?_sort=model"
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

1. **Dockerfile Naming**: Ensure the Dockerfile is named correctly without any extension like `.txt`. Incorrect file naming will prevent Docker from recognizing and using the file.

2. **Using Curl in Command Prompt**: Itâ€™s essential to run `curl` commands in Command Prompt and not in PowerShell, as PowerShell handles quotation marks differently, which can cause errors in the commands.

3. **Accessing the Server**: Always use `http://localhost:8080` to access your server. Trying to access it via `http://0.0.0.0:8080` can lead to issues, especially on Windows systems where `0.0.0.0` may not be interpreted correctly as localhost.

### Conclusion

This guide offers a thorough overview of setting up, monitoring, and interacting with a REST API using modern tools and best practices. The details provided ensure that even those new to such setups can proceed with confidence and avoid common errors.
